# Metropolis latex theme

forked from [repo](https://github.com/matze/mtheme)

## Installation

To install a stable version of this theme, please refer to update instructions
of your TeX distribution. Metropolis is on [CTAN][] since December
2014 thus it is part of MikTeX and will be part of TeX Live 2016.

Installing Metropolis from source, like any Beamer theme, involves four easy
steps:

1. **Download the source** with a `git clone` of the [Metropolis repository](https://github.com/matze/mtheme)
   or as a [zip archive](https://github.com/matze/mtheme/archive/master.zip) of
   the latest development version.
2. **Compile the style files** by running `make sty` inside the downloaded
    directory. (Or run LaTeX directly on `source/metropolistheme.ins`.)
3. **Move the resulting `*.sty` files** to the folder containing your
   presentation. To use Metropolis with many presentations, run `make install`
   or move the `*.sty` files to a folder in your TeX path instead (might require
   `sudo` rights).
4. **Use the theme for your presentation** by declaring `\usetheme{metropolis}` in
    the preamble of your Beamer document.
5. **For best results** install Mozilla's [Fira Sans](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraSans).


## Usage

The following code shows a minimal example of a Beamer presentation using
Metropolis.

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{metropolis}           % Use metropolis theme
\title{A minimal example}
\date{\today}
\author{Matthias Vogelgesang}
\institute{Centre for Modern Beamer Themes}
\begin{document}
  \maketitle
  \section{First Section}
  \begin{frame}{First Frame}
    Hello, world!
  \end{frame}
\end{document}
```

Detailed information on using Metropolis can be found in the [manual][].

excellent [owl](https://github.com/rchurchley/beamercolortheme-owl) theme.
